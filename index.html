        <p><strong>In this blog I will <em>only</em> be talking about <em>two</em> of these seven places!</strong> I enjoyed all and keep in mind, the two <em>aren't</em> my <em>favorite</em> two (wish I could talk about all, but it would take too long).</p>
        
        <h2 id="mpb">Montenegro Ploce Beach</h2>
        <h6>2014-2019 Summer</h6>
        
        <p class="intro"><strong>Montenegro isn't very well known</strong> and it's <strong>pretty small on the map.</strong> But I've been to Montenegro so many times and <em>trust me,</em> it's <em><strong>beautiful</strong></em>. Yes, Montenegro is where my parents come from and serbian is my home language. Just because I'm basically from Montenegro, doesn't mean I'll make up stuff to make it seem <strong>so great</strong>, I <em>mean</em> it.</p>
        <h4>There are gorgeous never ending mountains...</h4>

        <p class="detail">But as you know, <strong>today I'll be talking about Ploce beach and the <em>countless</em> memories it brings back.</strong><br> I remember, me and my family <em>loved</em> that place and we <em>still</em> do. It's our #1 beach destination where we like to spend 7-10 days. We find a hotel or rent a house close to Ploce. Then it usually takes 5 minutes by car to get there. We go 1-2 times/day because it <strong><em>never</em> gets boring!<br></strong> You can go to their <strong>restaurant</strong> that consists of delicious food and an awesome beach view. You can enjoy some <strong>fun activities like parasailing, jetskiing, towable (sofa), etc.</strong> I know some people prefer to go to the pool instead of the salty beach, so you can even swim in Ploce's <strong>kid or adult pool.</strong> Ploce isn't very known around Montenegro so you <em>won't</em> find many photos, but I recommend to keep searching. It's a great rocky looking beach.<br> Me and my family love to invite some friends over who were either from Montenegro, or came to visit it like us! My family's <em>favorite</em> activity was <strong>jumping off a cliff right into the water.</strong> It might sound crazy, but don't worry, it wasn't <em>that</em> high. However people did flips, dives, spins, cannonballs or just some regular jumps. To be honest, I wasn't <em>as</em> brave for the flips. I did some dives but in the lower area, and you can say I <em>tried</em> to do a backflip. I'll get better next year!</p>
        
        
        <h2 id="gwl">Great Wolf Lodge</h2>
        <h6>2013 & 2015 & 2017 Winter</h6>
        
        <p class="intro"><strong>Great Wolf Lodge is an <em>amazing</em> water park,</strong><em>especially</em> for kids. This is a really great place to look back to one day as a <strong>family memory.</strong> You may go there for a <strong>fun, warm and relaxing winter.</strong> Or an <strong>outdoor fun hot summer.</strong> Maybe even your <strong>birthday</strong>. <br>It consists of <strong>a gift store, daily storytelling event, wizard quest, cozy main room, single water rides, duo water rides, family water rides, water slides, kid parks, a surfing area, wave pool, restaurants, an arcade, a bowling room, a spa and your cozy rooms.</strong> Such a <strong>memorable place!</strong></p>
        
        <h4>Here are some pictures to get to know Great Wolf Lodge a little better...</h4>

        <p class="detail">Personally, I think Great Wolf Lodge is such a <strong>fun</strong> and <strong>cozy</strong> place. <em>I</em> prefer to go during the winter because it's <em>all</em> fun and warm indoor while outside it's <em>all</em> snowy. The <em>second</em> I walked in, I got this <strong>cozy at home feeling</strong>. The worker put a coloured plastic bracelet on our hands as he/she measured our height. It <strong>wasn't <em>any</em> kind of bracelet</strong>, there was a <strong>built in <em>fob</em></strong> that could <em>only</em> <strong>open our apartment door</strong>! The room we chose had a bunkbed. So me and my brother <strong>"fought"</strong> for it. We <em>might</em> go next year because we miss Great Wolf Lodge, even though we're all "grown up". So there will be <em>a lot</em> of thinking on who had the <strong>top bunk</strong> last (2017).<br> Some of the <strong>rides</strong> were <strong>chill,</strong> like the flowing water, where you just layed in your water tube (alone or with someone) as the water pushed you along the tour. Then there are the <strong>family rides,</strong> like the Wooly Mamooth that casually swung side to side <em>pretty</em> fast. I also remember a ride my family likes to call the <strong>Toilet ride</strong>, it's where you are in a tube in the dark, then <em>all</em> of a sudden the area opens up as you slide around the funnel and "flush" down the hole. We <em>can't</em> forget the <strong>arcade</strong>, there were <em>so</em> many <strong>great games and prizes!</strong> <strong><br>I 100% recommend Great Wolf Lodge for you and your family and/or friends!!</strong></p>
